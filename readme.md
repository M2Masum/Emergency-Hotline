4. What is **Event Delegation** in JavaScript? Why is it useful?<br>

5. What is the difference between **preventDefault() and stopPropagation()** methods?<br>
Ans:<br>
preventDefault() prevents default behaviour. <br>
on the other side<br>
stopPropagation() prevents an event from bubbling up (or capturing down) the DOM, so parent elements wonâ€™t be triggered by that event.
